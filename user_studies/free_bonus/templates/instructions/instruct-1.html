		    There are two parts to this HIT:
	    </p>

			<h2>Part 1: Allocate money among a group of people</h2>
			You will be told a very short story about how three men
			answer questions to get money. You will then be asked to
			"fairly" distribute the money they win among the three men.
			<br>

			<h2>Part 2: Detect simulated lending application fraud</h2>
			In this task you will play the role of a lending agent who has
			recieved many loan applications.<br>
			<br>
			There is an AI computer algorithm that
			computes a "lending score" for each application. Applications with
			a positive score will be accepted by the bank, while those with a
			negative score will be rejected.<br>
			<br>
			If you forward an application to the bank and it is accepted you make $100
			in commission (in game money, not real money). But if you an application to
			the bank and it is rejected you lose $100 to pay for the bank's trouble.<br>
			<br>
			The challenging part is that applicants may have lied (at most once) on their
			application in order to get a better score. So your job is to guess if the
			applicant lied in a way that changed their lending score from being negative
			to being positive.
